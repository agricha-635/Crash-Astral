# Crash-Astral 🚀

**Crash Astral** is a thrilling rocket crash game that focuses on high-risk, high-reward gameplay. The game mechanics are similar to **Aviator**, where you need to exit your rocket before it crashes to secure your winnings.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Crash Astral**, you watch your rocket ascend, and as it gains altitude, both the risk and reward increase. Like **Aviator**, you need to make a timely decision to exit the rocket before it crashes, or you'll lose everything.

### Core Mechanics:

- **High-risk, high-reward**: The more risk you take, the higher your potential rewards.
- **Real-time decisions**: You must exit the rocket at the right time, but the longer you wait, the greater the chance of crashing.
- **Instant restarts**: If you crash, the level restarts, giving you a fresh chance to try a new strategy.

## 🧑‍🚀 Features

- **Aviator-style Gameplay**: Your rocket continuously gains altitude, and you need to decide when to safely exit.
- **Dynamic Flight Simulation**: Rocket movement is based on realistic physics, with momentum and gravity playing a role.
- **Progressive Risk**: The further you go, the higher the risk and the greater the potential reward.
- **Challenging Levels**: Each level increases in difficulty, requiring improved reflexes and decision-making.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Launch**: Your rocket will automatically start ascending.
2. **Monitor Altitude**: The higher your rocket goes, the greater the risk and reward.
3. **Exit Before Crash**: You must exit the rocket at the right moment to secure your winnings. If the rocket crashes, you lose.
4. **Restart**: If you crash, the level restarts, and you get another chance to test your luck and strategy.
